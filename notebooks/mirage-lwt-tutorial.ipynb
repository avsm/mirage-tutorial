A good way to understand Lwt and its use in Mirage is to write some simple code. This notebook introduces the basic concepts alongside some simple exercises. Example code for all exercises is in the [mirage-skeleton/lwt/src](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/lwt/src) repository.\n\nNote that, although Lwt has several syntax extensions that have been widely used in Mirage in the past, current idiomatic usage is to avoid the syntax extensions in favour of direct operators. \n\n## Concepts\n\nHere we give a minimal introduction to Lwt. See the [Lwt manual](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/manual/) for full details. \n\n### `return`\n\nThe first useful function is the `return` statement, which constructs a constant thread:\n\n```ocaml\n  val return: 'a -> 'a Lwt.t\n```\n\nIt is used to construct a thread that immediately returns with the provided value. Once the value is wrapped in an Lwt thread, it cannot directly be used (as the thread may not have completed yet). \n\n### `bind`\n\nThis is where `bind` comes in:\n\n```ocaml\n  val bind: 'a Lwt.t -> ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> 'b Lwt.t\n```\n\n`bind t f` creates a thread which waits for `t` to terminate, then passes the result to `f`. If `t` is a sleeping thread, then `bind t f` will be a sleeping thread too, until `t` terminates. If `t` fails, then the resulting thread will fail with the same exception.\n\n### `join` / `choose`\n\nThere are two important operations to compose threads: `join` and `choose`.\n\n```ocaml\n  val join : unit Lwt.t list -> unit Lwt.t\n```\n\n`join` takes a list of threads and waits for all of them to terminate. If at least one thread fails then `join l` will fail with the same exception as the first to fail, after all threads terminate.\n\n```ocaml\n val choose : 'a t list -> 'a t\n```\n\n`choose l` behaves as the first thread in l to terminate. If several threads are already terminated, one is chosen at random.\n\nThe infix operators `<&>` and `<?>` are defined in the Lwt module, where `a <&> b` is equivalent to `join [a; b]`, and `a <?> b` is equivalent to `choose [a; b]`.\n\n### Core Event Loop\n\nThe core of Lwt is based on an event loop. In \"standard\" (non-Mirage) settings, this loop is started using the `Lwt_main.run` function. However, when using Mirage, the loop is automatically started by the `main.ml` file autogenerated by the mirage command-line tool.\nBecause it's based on an event loop, threads are actually very cheap in Lwt when compared to preemptive system threads. Sleeping actually registers an event that will wake up the associated thread when possible. Depending on the backend, the event registering slightly differs."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we go any further, let's load the `Lwt` libraries:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"#require \"lwt,lwt.syntax\"","cell_type":"code","prompt_number":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"\tCamlp4 Parsing version 4.01.0\n\n","stream":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"/Users/mort/.opam/system/lib/lwt: added to search path\n/Users/mort/.opam/system/lib/lwt/lwt.cma: loaded\n","stream":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"/Users/mort/.opam/system/lib/lwt/lwt-syntax-options.cma: loaded\n","stream":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"/Users/mort/.opam/system/lib/lwt/lwt-syntax.cma: loaded\n","stream":"stderr"}],"language":"python","collapsed":false},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Ex.1: Sleep and Join\n\nWrite a program that spins off two threads, each of which sleep for some amount of time, say 1 and 2 seconds and then one prints \"Heads\", the other \"Tails\".

Luckily, Lwt includes a comprehensive [pa_lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/api/Pa_lwt) syntax extension that makes writing threaded code as convenient as vanilla OCaml. Mirage includes this extension by default, so you can use it anywhere you want.\n\nThis is a good place to introduce some of these extensions. When opening the Lwt module, the infix operator `>>=` is made available. This operator is an alternative to the `bind` function and often makes the code more readable.
