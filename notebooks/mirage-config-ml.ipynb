This is the basic structure required to make this a Mirage unikernel rather than a standard OCaml POSIX application.\n\nThe concrete implementation of `CONSOLE` will be supplied at compile-time, depending on the target that you are compiling for.  This configuration is stored in `config.ml`, which is very simple for our first application.\n\n## 2. Write a `config.ml`\n\nThe `config.ml` specifies a set of **jobs**, equivalent to top-level threads with attached devices, that represent processes with start/stop lifecycle. In this case it is rather simple as the only device depended upon is the `console`:"},{"metadata":{},"input":"module Config = struct\n    open Mirage\n    \n    let main = \n        foreign \"Unikernel.Main\" (console @-> job)\n    \n    let jobs = [\n        main $ default_console\n        ]\n    \n    (* This completes the `config.ml` by giving an entry point where\n       `jobs` are registered, effectively to specify the the top-level \n       `Lwt` threads that are invoked at start-of-day.

Each job most likely depends on some device drivers; all the available device drivers are [defined in the `Mirage` module](http://mirage.github.io/mirage).\n\nIn this case, the `main` variable declares that the entry point of the process is the `Main` module from the file `unikernel.ml`.  The `@->` combinator is used to add a device driver to the list of functor arguments in the job definition (see `unikernel.ml`), and the final value of using this combinator should always be a `job` if you intend to register it.\n\nNotice that we refer to the module name as a string here, instead of directly as an OCaml value.  The `mirage` command-line tool evaluates this configuration file at build-time and outputs a `main.ml` that has the concrete values filled in for you, with the exact modules varying by which backend you selected (e.g. Unix or Xen).\n\nMirage mirrors the Xen model on UNIX as far as possible: your application is built as a unikernel which needs to be instantiated and run whether on UNIX or on Xen. When your unikernel is run, it starts much as a VM on Xen does -- and so must be passed references to devices such as the console, network interfaces and block devices on startup.\n\nIn this case, this simple `hello world` example requires just a console for output, so we register a single `Job` consisting of the `Unikernel.Main` module (and, implicitly its `start` function) and passing it a single reference to a console.\n\nYou can find the module signatures of all the device drivers (such as `CONSOLE`) in the [`types/`](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/tree/master/types) directory of the main Mirage repository.  Since you'll find yourself referring back to these quite often when building Mirage applications, it's worth bookmarking the [documentation](http://mirage.github.io) for this module."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.
